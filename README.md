Daily UI 011

So, for this challenge I had to create success and failure flash cards. 
Since, I can't remember seeing those I went and searched for examples.
Anyway, it's main point is mostly usage of icons; checked for success
and x for failure. What I found interesting was also usage of colors, 
green for success and red for failure. Which gave me idea, since I have 
"Animal Kingdom brand" I could use two images, one for success and one for 
failure and then implement colors.

All in all, I started using mixins more often which is kinda plus for me.
Which leaves sass functions next :D

Anyway, onward to next project!
